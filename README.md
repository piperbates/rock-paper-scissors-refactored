# Rock Paper Scissors

This was my very first hackathon project back on week one of the School of Code and as my first day completing the 100 days of code challenge I decided to redo it.

The original challenge was to make the classic game, with a score tracker and number of games played shown. My original version had the user type their answers, whereas I have changed it to be images for a better overall user experience.
